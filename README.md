# Summer '25 Project - Portfolio

## Portfolio Features
This responsive portfolio web app is designed to showcase my creative and technical work in a visually engaging way. It includes:
- A vertical collage-art timeline highlighting key (or not so key) years in my life from 2010 to 2025
- A fixed-position sidebar with:
  - Image-based navigation cards
  - Social links to GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, and VSCO
  - Downloadable resume button
- Mobile-friendly hamburger menu with overlay for smaller screens
- Clean transitions between pages like Home and About

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** with custom media queries for responsiveness
- **JavaScript** for UI interactions (sidebar toggle, keyboard events)

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
3. Use browser developer tools to test responsive behavior on different screen sizes.

## Customization
To make this portfolio your own:
- Replace the image files inside the `/assets` folder
- Update your social and resume links in the HTML
- Edit styling in `styles.css` to match your aesthetic
- Swap out the year image blocks or add new ones 
- Rewrite skillset and summary in `about.html`

## Known Issues
- The VSCO button may appear too large or misaligned on ultra-wide screens
